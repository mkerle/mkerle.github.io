Snort has many uses including IDS (Intrusion Detection).

## SNORT Rules

Snort rules are described in `/usr/local/etc/rules/local.rules`.

An example Snort rules looks like the below which could be used to detect ICMP traffic between two networks.  The "<>" would detect ICMP traffic in either direction.  The "any" refers to the port(s) to use in the detection.  "sid" is a snort id to relate detections back to a rule (a sid can also include a revision).

{% highlight snort %}
alert icmp $DMZ_NET any <> $EXT_NET any ( msg:"ICMP Traffic Detected"; sid:10000001; metadata:policy security-ips alert;)
{% endhighlight %}

Check the SNORT [infographic][snort-infographic] for quick hints on the format of SNORT rules.

## Applying SNORT Rule Changes

To apply a change to Snort rules restart the snort service.  Assuming service dedicated for an "external" interface.

{% highlight bash %}
sudo systemctl restart snort3_external
{% endhighlight %}

## Checking SNORT Logs

SNORT logs can be found in `/var/log/snort/`.


## Writing Advanced Custom SNORT Rules

TBC.
